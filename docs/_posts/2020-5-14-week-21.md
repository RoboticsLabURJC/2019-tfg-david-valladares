## WEEK 21

1. This week, I have modified the development that I am making so that the integration works by means of a single button. Steps that are performed when pressing the button:     
    - Once the button is pressed, first open the port so that it does not give the problem of user permissions.   
    - Then get the binary.
    - Finally, upload the program to the mbot through the avrgirl library.    
    - To achieve this process, I have had to modify the avrgil library. Since it opened the port when it called.   
    - I have added error messages and a follow bar to be able to give feedback to the user.   
    - [*Video of the implementation*](https://youtu.be/94RD84A32SQ)   
    
2. I've done a little research on how [PyInstaler](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    - I have analyzed the kibotics-drivers/tello repository to understand how it is mounted and what is the procedure that follows.
