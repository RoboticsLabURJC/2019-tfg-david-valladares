## WEEK 22

1. I've added a bit of [documentation]() explaining the development done with the web serial API.   

2. I have opened an issue in the web server repository to integrate it into the master branch.   

3. I have added a little change to the kibotics page layout for the real mbot, adding only one button (run).

4. I have made a small example of a python program for the real mbot => [Video of the program](https://youtu.be/jdsOy0_BhW0)

5. I configured the kibotics-drives repository on my local machine to be able to use the tello drone. I've managed to get it up and running.
