## WEEK 22

1. I've added a bit of [documentation](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2019-tfg-david-valladares/blob/master/WebSerialApi/documentacion.md) explaining the development done with the web serial API.   

2. I have opened an issue in the web server repository to integrate it into the master branch.   

3. I have added a little change to the kibotics page layout for the real mbot, adding only one button (run).

   Also I have added the procedure to load the program in macOs and windows with api webserial, in the webIDE exercises for the real mbot.

5. I configured the kibotics-drives repository on my local machine to be able to use the tello drone. I've managed to get it up and running.
