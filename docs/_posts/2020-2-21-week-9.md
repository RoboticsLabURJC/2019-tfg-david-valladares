## WEEK 9

1. I have tried to prove the realization of mbot and tello real exercises, using kiboctis. But I have encountered many problems and I have not been able to do this work.
    -   For Mbot
        -  Python:
            -   When I was running the executable file obtained, it was not loading because it gives me a library error. I have tried even with an example of basic code.
                ~~~
                import HALduino.halduino as halduino
                def loop():
                    distancia = halduino.get_us()           
                ~~~
                ERROR
                
                ![ERROR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dvalladaresv/TFG_David_Valladares/master/assets/error_python_mbot.png)
                ---
                
        -   Scratch:
            - When I tried to get the executable, I downloaded a .zip that could not be opened.

    -   For Tello:
        -   Python:
            -   When I was trying to get the executable, he told me what a mistake it was to get the code. I have even tried a very basic program.
            -   If the line *from tello.tello_wrapper import Drone* is deleted, it stops giving the error that it cannot obtain the code
                ~~~
                from tello.tello_wrapper import Drone
                import time
                tel = Drone('',9005)
                tel.despegar()
                ~~~
                
                  ERROR:
                
           ![ERROR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dvalladaresv/TFG_David_Valladares/master/assets/error_python_tello.png)
     
 
        -  Scratch:
            -    When I run the executable file it indicates that a syntax error is occurring. I enclose the code that I have used and the error.

2. I have tried to advance a little more in the communication between the serial port of the arduino board and the browser through WebSerial Api. I have tried to implement that the executable can be sent via the serial port to the board and the program is loaded.
   After several attempts I could not get such implementations. If I could select the file and read it. But when you pass it to the board, it looks like it arrives from the flickering of the RX, but it doesn't run the program. Initially, what was read from the file.ino happened to him, but after investigating more, what I have tried to pass him is the file already compiled file.ino.hex in hexadecimal format. But without any effect.
   
   - As for the developed website, we first connect to the board. Once connected we choose the file that we want to send through the serial port and show its content to see that it is being read well.
