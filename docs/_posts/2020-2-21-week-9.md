## WEEK 9

1. I have tried to prove the realization of mbot and tello real exercises, using kiboctis. But I have encountered many problems and I have not been able to do this work.
    -   For Mbot
        -  Python:
            -   When I was running the executable file obtained, it was not loading because it gives me a library error. I have tried even with an example of basic code.
                ~~~
                import HALduino.halduino as halduino
                def loop():
                    distancia = halduino.get_us()           
                ~~~

        -   Scratch:
            - When I tried to get the executable, I downloaded a .zip that could not be opened.
            
                Codigo:

    -   For Tello:
        -   Python:
            -   When I was trying to get the executable, he told me what a mistake it was to get the code. I have even tried a very basic program.
                ~~~
                from tello.tello_wrapper import Drone
                import time
                tel = Drone('',9005)
                tel.despegar()
                ~~~
                
                ERROR:
                ***

            - If the line *from tello.tello_wrapper import Drone* is deleted, it stops giving the error that it cannot obtain the code
        -  Scratch:
            -    When I run the executable file it indicates that a syntax error is occurring. I enclose the code that I have used and the error.
