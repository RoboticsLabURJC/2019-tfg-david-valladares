## WEEK 19

1. First of all, I was able to test the operation of the integration of webserial in kibotics-webserber from the MacOs (version 10.15.4) and Windows10 machines. 
    - In order to test it, I needed to raise the server by https.I found a package for quite useful for django that allows to indicate that the application is lifted by https, to use this package:   
        1. Installation => pip install django-sslserver   
        2. Add the application to your INSTALLED_APPS   
        3. To raise the server => **python manage.py runsslserver 127.0.0.1:{puerto}**       
        4. To access => https://localhost:{puerto} or from another machine => https://{ip_public_machine_server}:{puerto}
        * For more information => [Django SSL Server](https://github.com/teddziuba/django-sslserver)   
        
    
2. Web server integration analysis:   
    - For both systems indicated in the previous section, the program can be downloaded to the mbot. Below you can see the proof:   
        * For => [MacOS(version 10.15.4)](https://youtu.be/-R_E3F8jVWE)   
        * For => [Windows 10](https://youtu.be/4Wq4kMRUeIc)
    
    - But there is a **bug**, since sometimes the program loads perfectly by pressing the "Run Mbot", but other times it fails when it tries to open the seral port for permissions.

        - If after pressing the execute button once, and after waiting a few seconds, the window to select the port does not appear. A solution to this problem would be to do the following:   
            - *Press the run button once and then press again after a few seconds. This way is not efficient, but this version is in beta, I am working to implement improvements.*
