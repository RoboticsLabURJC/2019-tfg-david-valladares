## WEEK 26

1. I have recorded two example videos to load the program to real tello in python and in scratch for the channel [kibotics](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kibotics).   
    - For Python => [Simple Tello exercise tutorial with Python](https://youtu.be/M1RNISeTB6Q)   
    - For Scratch => [Simple Tello exercise tutorial with Scratch](https://youtu.be/GZGUVG-Q-44)   

2. To get the process on windows and macOS:   
   - We think about the solution of the packaging of code in python, I have been researching how to do it and had some problems that I am trying to solve.   
   - For the packaging, it is necessary to add both the external libraries (this if I have succeeded) and the libraries of kibotics-drives/tello, These are the ones that I'm having trouble packing.     
   - I am using setuptool.
