## WEEK 27-28-29

1. I have improved two example videos to load the program to physical tello in python and in scratch for the channel [kibotics](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kibotics).   
    - For Python => [Simple Tello exercise tutorial with Python](https://youtu.be/k3Q3qbknd78)   
    - For Scratch => [Simple Tello exercise tutorial with Scratch](https://youtu.be/31vynFaEngk)   

2. I have continued investigating how to achieve the integration of the tello drone from kibotics with MacOs and Windows. Check if with PyInstaller you could only make the self-contained file without entering the python interpreter, which is what gives problems when not allowing a cross compilation, but I have not see the way to do it by this method. I have found a possible way to do it for windows, by using [wine](https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu):   
    - **Wine** (recursive backronym for Wine Is Not an Emulator) is a free and open-source compatibility layer that aims to allow computer programs (application software and computer games) developed for Microsoft Windows to run on Unix-like operating systems. Wine also provides a software library, known as Winelib, against which developers can compile Windows applications to help port them to Unix-like systems     
    - The idea would be to use pyinstaller previously installed inside wine and to be able to run it from there.   
    ~~~
   $ wine python.exe Scripts/pip.exe install pyinstaller
   ~~~
    - I have tried integrating it in kibotics-web server and it is able to get the .exe, but it fails when executing it because it is not integrating the necessary library. I will try to investigate further how to fix this bug.   
    - Disadvantages of using wine:   
        - It requires previously installing wine on the machine where the server is running.

3. I have started to study how the flask library works to use it with the raspberry pi. I have made an example that consists of turning on two LEDs from a web page.   
    - [Video with the example](https://youtu.be/LAUKq96QRf8)
    - Sample code:   
    ~~~
    import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
    from flask import Flask, render_template, request
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
    
    # Create a dictionary called pins to store the pin number, name, and pin state:
    pins = {
       23 : {'name' : 'GPIO 23', 'state' : GPIO.LOW},
       24 : {'name' : 'GPIO 24', 'state' : GPIO.LOW}
       }
    
    # Set each pin as an output and make it low:
    for pin in pins:
       GPIO.setup(pin, GPIO.OUT)
       GPIO.output(pin, GPIO.LOW)
    
    @app.route("/")
    def main():
       # For each pin, read the pin state and store it in the pins dictionary:
       for pin in pins:
          pins[pin]['state'] = GPIO.input(pin)
       # Put the pin dictionary into the template data dictionary:
       templateData = {
          'pins' : pins
          }
       # Pass the template data into the template main.html and return it to the user
       return render_template('main.html', **templateData)
    
    # The function below is executed when someone requests a URL with the pin number and action in it:
    @app.route("/<changePin>/<action>")
    def action(changePin, action):
       # Convert the pin from the URL into an integer:
       changePin = int(changePin)
       # Get the device name for the pin being changed:
       deviceName = pins[changePin]['name']
       # If the action part of the URL is "on," execute the code indented below:
       if action == "on":
          # Set the pin high:
          GPIO.output(changePin, GPIO.HIGH)
          # Save the status message to be passed into the template:
          message = "Turned " + deviceName + " on."
       if action == "off":
          GPIO.output(changePin, GPIO.LOW)
          message = "Turned " + deviceName + " off."
    
       # For each pin, read the pin state and store it in the pins dictionary:
       for pin in pins:
          pins[pin]['state'] = GPIO.input(pin)
    
       # Along with the pin dictionary, put the message into the template data dictionary:
       templateData = {
          'pins' : pins
       }
    
       return render_template('main.html', **templateData)   
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":   
       app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80, debug=True)
