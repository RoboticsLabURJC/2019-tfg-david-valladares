## WEEK 11

1. This week he continued trying to load the binary to the bale using WebSerialApi:
   
    1.1. Firstly investigate the stk500 protocol used by the arduino fireware bootlader. This protocol consists of a series of messages to get the load.   
    
    1.2. I have also visualized the avrdude code (since it is free software) of how it implements this protocol. It is implemented in C.
    
    1.3. Once I understand this mechanism better, find out if there is a library that already implements this protocol translated into javaScript and I found a quite interesting one called [avrgirl-arduino](https://github.com/noopkat/avrgirl-arduino). Through this library and thanks to an example of how to load it through WebSerial, I managed to upload the binary to the board. Below I show two videos with the examples I have made.

         1.3.1. Example 1: Cargar a la placa arduino ejemplo de encendido y apagado del led => Blink.hex => [Video with example 1](https://youtu.be/Yr9rwSqcTbE).  
         1.3.2. Example 2: Upload a program to Mbot, using a .hex generated by the kibotics server => [Video with example2](https://youtu.be/YLt0hx1vMHc).  
                 * They gave me a .hex generated by the server of the following program for the Mbot, which consists of showing hi! by the led matrix of the Mbot.

        import HALduino.halduino as halduino
         def loop():
            halduino.draw_string("hi!")
