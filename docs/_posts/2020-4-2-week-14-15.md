## WEEK 14 - 15

1. I have installed on the local kibotics web server with all the necessary components to be able to reproduce, through the exercise of the real mbot, how the executable is achieved   
    - I was able to debug through the application to see the steps that are followed to obtain said executable.

2. I have realized that web development of webserial is served on the same server as webserver.   
    2.1 For this I have created a new app with django within the webserver/jdrobot_server/project.   
    2.2 Within this app I have added templates, the static resources necessary to serve the development of webserial.   
    2.3 I have also added the necessary views and urls.
