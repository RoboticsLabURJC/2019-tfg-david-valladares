## WEEK 10

1. I have continued to use kibotics for real robot implementationn with Scratch.
        
      -   Exercice 1: [Exercise 1: Move forward until Mbot see an obstacle nearby](https://youtu.be/-o47qhpqZkU)

      -   Exercise 2: [When the button that shows 'OOF' is pressed and when 'ON' is not pressed](https://youtu.be/-HziQPKAZ2I).

2. The attempt to continue moving forward with WebSerialApi

    2.1. In the first place, try to put into operation the example of the PEPE repository. To do this, create a node server with the Express library that serves the html resource. But it kept giving me problems. To continue moving forward with this part I have written to Kaelhm to better understand how it is mounted.
    ~~~
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    
    app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public/'));
    
    app.listen('3000', function() {
      console.log('Servidor web escuchando en el puerto 3000');
    });
    ~~~

    2.2. I have continued testing my development implemented with the [KaelHem](https://github.com/kaelhem) library, but when loading the program it gives me a timeout and fails.

    2.3. I have investigated the [STK500](http://www.tuxgraphics.org/common/src2/article05101/stk500_spec_AVR068.pdf) protocol, which is used to load the program. I have found a repository in [GitHub](https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/js-stk500v1) that implements this protocol translated into javaScript, but currently it is only allowed for the Arduino Mega board.
