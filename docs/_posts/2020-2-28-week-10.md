## WEEK 10

1. I have continued to use kibotics for real robot implementation.Below I show a series of exercises performed in python for the Mbot and the steps to load the executable.

      -  [Load executable for Python Mbot](https://youtu.be/r24DTmMXJ-4).
        
      -   Exercice 1: Exercise 1: Show 'Hi!' by the Mbot screen.
        
            ~~~
            import HALduino.halduino as halduino
            def loop():
                halduino.draw_string("HI!")
            ~~~

      -   Exercise 2: [When the button that shows 'OOF' is pressed and when 'ON' is not pressed](https://youtu.be/pS5OE_WwG7g).
              
             ~~~
                
             import HALduino.halduino as halduino
             def loop():
                    
                if halduino.is_button_released():
                    halduino.draw_string("ON")
                else:
                    halduino.draw_string("OOF!")
               
             ~~~
       
      -  En cuanto a realizar los ejercicios con Scratch segui teniendo problemas, debido a que conseguia obtener el ejecutable.
      
2. I have continued to make progress on development with WebSerialApi. As for the previous week that he was able to read the .hex, after reading documentation, all the fields and the [format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX) were being read well.
    - The problem is that it was converted to String when read. And he also had the other problem of how to charge it to the robot.
    - Try to look at the traces that were displayed when loading the .hex by means of avrdude => *avrdude -v -p atmega328p -c arduino -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 57600 -D -U flash:w:blink.hex:i* , but you cannot interpret much information about whether more headers were added or how it behaved.
    - Looking for more information, I found several repository on GitHub, which dealt with the issue of how to parse the .hex and how to load it. Even one of those repositories provided a library. So I have been trying to understand the code in order to continue with the development.
    - I have managed to parse the .hex that I receive well, but I still have to develop the behavior of loading it on the board. Currently it tries to load it and the message is received, but it does not execute it.
    - A continuacion dejo un video de una prueba del desarrollo [Video WebSerial Api](https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/js-stk500v1)
